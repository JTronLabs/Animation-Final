This game follows a humanoid protagonist as he uses his ability to invert gravity to solve puzzles and beat levels. 

The humanoid must dodge moving objects and watch out for holes in the level, if he falls out he dies! He also must be wary of objects that could hurt him, for example falling cubes and poisonous particles.

Three levels were implemented.
